# frontend
Frontend for the OpenWeatherGrid API. 

### todo
- [ ] Angular 2.x (The reason why it isn't written in Angular 2.x is that I was in the process of learning it when I started working on this project, and it took me extra time because the guides for ES2015 well, were missing and there aren't many tutorials.
- [ ] Unit testing... (DO IT.)
